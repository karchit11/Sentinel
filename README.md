🛡️ WebSentinel: HTTP Traffic Attack AnalysisWebSentinel is an automated Intrusion Detection System (IDS) dashboard designed to analyze HTTP traffic logs in real-time. It solves the challenge of manual log inspection by automatically detecting, classifying, and visualizing malicious URL patterns.🚀 The ProblemModern organizations face massive volumes of web traffic logs. Security teams struggle to manually inspect these logs to distinguish between:Harmless trafficFailed attack attempts (e.g., a firewall blocking an XSS attack)Successful breaches (e.g., an SQL injection that returned sensitive data)💡 The SolutionWebSentinel acts as a "Robot Security Guard." It parses web logs and uses signature-based detection (Regex) to identify specific attack patterns. It then visualizes this data in a modern React dashboard, allowing security analysts to filter threats by type, severity, and outcome.✨ Key FeaturesAttack Detection: Automatically flags SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Directory Traversal, and Command Injection.Outcome Classification:🔴 Critical/Success: Detects potential data leaks (e.g., HTTP 200 responses with large payloads during an attack).🟡 Attempt: Identifies attacks blocked by the server (e.g., HTTP 403/401).Real-Time Dashboard: A responsive UI to monitor traffic trends and attack velocity.Search & Filter: deeply analyze logs by IP address, timestamp, or attack category.🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: React, TypeScript, ViteStyling: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)Runtime: Node.js💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js (LTS Version) must be installed on your machine.InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/web-sentinel.git](https://github.com/your-username/web-sentinel.git)
